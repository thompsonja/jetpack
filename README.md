jetpack
=======

This is a modified college project (see ProjectDescription.pdf).  I added jetpack functionality for fun and removed some unnecessary features.  This project was originally created early on in my college career and was thus very hacked together.

My goals with this project are as follows:
1. Practice refactoring by updating old code.  This code is essentially C code which was later ported at the end of the project to C++.  It needs a lot of rearchitecting and simplification.
2. Update libraries to latest versions (OpenGL, glut, SDL, etc.)
3. Port to OpenGL ES for mobile
4. Add Linux support
