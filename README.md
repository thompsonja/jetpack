jetpack
=======

This is a modified college project (see ProjectDescription.pdf) with added jetpack functionality.  This project was originally created early on in my college career.

My goals with this project are as follows:
1. Practice refactoring by updating old code.  This code is essentially C code which was later ported at the end of the project to C++.  It needs a lot of rearchitecting and simplification.
2. Update libraries to latest versions (OpenGL, glut, SDL, etc.)
3. Port to OpenGL ES for mobile
